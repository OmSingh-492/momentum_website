                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am Om Singh, currently an Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. I have been trading paaively since May 2023, and actively since
                    May 2024. Initially, thanks to beginner's luck, I was able to generate excellent profits. But soon, I realised that generating profits by trading the 
                    wrong way is more dangerous than generating losses trading the right way.
                </p>
                <p>I initially read a lot of books on the subject. Personally, Investing for long-term is something which didn't appeal to me much. I felt I don't have the patience
                    to go through large drawdowns, expecting good returns at the end of it. Also, I found out that no single strategy exists which can work all the time.
                </p>
                <p>I believe there is a big role of pure intution in trading, and I personally haven't found a single algorithm which does beat the markets consistently over time.
                    If anybody claims to have one, I would encourage the reader to just go and backtest it, and look how difficult it is to beat the index. I think it requires a "Cautious Speculation"
                    to beat the markets in the long run.
                </p>
                <p>I feel I have developed an intuition on how to trade lately. My current strategy is a mix of Discretionary and Systems trading. I mostly use Systems trading on a lower timeframe, and 
                    take Discretionary Trades with a mix of Systems trading on a higher time frame, which seems to be working well currently.
                </p>
                <p>As a final note of caution, the methods used by me are highly leveraged, and extremely risky. Significant capital losses do take place, with my single biggest loss amounting to roughly 15% loss in a single trading session.
                    So, please stay aware of that! But, if you invest with us for a decent period of time, without panicking, atleast the history suggests I can generate alpha over the benchmark.
                </p>
                <p>Hope you become a part of this movement!</p>
