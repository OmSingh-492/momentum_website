            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the world of Quantitative Investing!</p>
            <p>
                At <strong>Momentum Investments</strong>, we rely on Algorithmic Models to take Investing to the next level. 
                Our proprietary Machine Learning-based models have been extensively back-tested as well as forward-tested 
                for the Indian Stock Market.

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                We engage in both long-term and intraday trading, aiming to generate high and consistent returns, 
                generating alpha over the NIFTY50 benchmark fund.
            </p>
            <p>
                We strongly believe everybody should benefit from investing, however small their capital may be! Hence, 
                depending on interest and traction, we might look to open our fund to the general public. We are planning 
                to launch the fund so that anybody can decide to either invest in a lump sum amount or start a SIP with a 
                capital as low as Rs. 500, making it accessible to everyone.
            </p>

            <h2>Transparency</h2>
            <p>
                With financial fraud on the rise, we prioritize transparency. We will display our live P/L at the end of 
                each trading day. As a bonus, at the end of the first 50 trading days, we will also share the positions 
                taken by us on that day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note: To prevent copying of trades, only closed positions will be shown after 10 pm on the respective day.
