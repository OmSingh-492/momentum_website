            <p>Welcome to the world of Quantitative Investing!</p>
            <p>
                We at <strong>Momentum Investments</strong> rely on Algorithmic Models to take Investing to the next level.
                Our proprietary Machine Learning-based models have been extensively back-tested as well as forward-tested
                for the Indian Stock Market.
            </p>
            <p>
                We engage in both long-term and intraday trading, aiming to generate high and consistent returns, 
                generating alpha over the NIFTY50 benchmark fund.

                We strongly believe everybody should benefit from investing, however small their capital may be! Hence, 
                depending on interest and traction, we might look to open our fund to the general public. We are planning to launch 
                the fund so that anybody can decide to either invest in a lumpsum amount or start a SIP with a capital as low as 
                Rs. 500, to make it accessible to everybody!

            <p>
                Of course, we understand that cases of financial fraud are on the rise. Therefore, we have decided that to maintain 
                transparency, we shall be displaying our live P/L at the end of each trading day. Also, as a bonus, at the end of the 
                first 50 trading days, we shall also share the positions taken by us on that day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that to prevent copying of trades, only closed positions shall be shown, after 10 pm on that day.
