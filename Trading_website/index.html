            <h2>Welcome to Momentum Investments!</h2>

            <h2>Transparency is our strength</h2>
            <p>To maintain transparency, I have decided that we shall be displaying our live unit worth at the end of each trading day (by 09:00 IST of the next trading day) starting from 25th of November, 2024.</p>
            <p>Only the positions shall be concealed from view, as trading is inherently risky in nature, and we are not SEBI-registered and hence not authorized to comment on the positions we are taking.</p>
            <p>A detailed analysis of the portfolio (initially divided into 10,000 units) shall be updated on a daily basis.</p>
